### Due to bad time management I did not complete those:

- App must use JWT token auth (token + refresh token). If backend responses with 401 unauthorized, it must send request with refresh token to
receive a new auth token and then retry necessary requests to backend.

- Ability to receive validation messages from the backend for example about
length limit.
All backend responses must be mocked by any solution.
